# Classification Model Application to Soccer Matches

### To whom it may concern


The information about the application is all available in the attached notebook.

The notebook was made on Google Colab so the data retrevial and some of the formatting may not work as intended.

Viewing access to my Google Colab notebook is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CkHq6P33IE62aVJPFO67Gnj7jhNjwAj9?usp=sharing).

I'd also like to stress that this data was used for educational purposes and does not belong to me nor does the processed version of the data, the only work that is mine is the code and text in the notebook.

Note: Due to Github's max file size I couldn't upload the matches csv. Access is available through this link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SIJGF12CiSSACpLemifoTFAdmrjtocQL/view?usp=sharing).
